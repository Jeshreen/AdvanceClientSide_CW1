            <h3> A boy and a girl can never be just friends. True or false?</h3>
           <p> Gone are the days when we human beings had BFF’s of the same sex. No longer do we take pride in friendships built only among members of the same human form. Boys and girls hanging out at malls, dining at restaurants and going out for movies are sights frequently seen in this present age. As a matter of fact, we tend to prefer the company of members of the opposite sex than of the same, which is why many of us have a best friend from the other gender. So, being in this type of friendship isn’t that easy as you’d imagine. Neither is it complicated. Apart from the happiness and all the goodness it brings, there are certain difficulties that you would encounter along the way of your friendship.</p>

            <p>The best thing about this kind of relationship is that you get to clear out all your doubts about the opposite gender. This makes socializing very interesting since you have a good idea of what you should talk in the presence of a boy if you are a girl, and a girl if you are a boy. The next thing is having a BFF from the other group revolves around honesty and trust. I’m not saying that it’s applicable to every friendship as such, but usually, a boy and a girl who are best friends will be more truthful to each other than what members of the same sex will be to each other. For instance, your friend will be the first to point out that you happen to be a fashion disaster today. He or she who points it out and laughs will not regret doing it even if it upsets you, because getting to know it from a person you can actually rely on is better than having a whole bunch of other people laughing at you behind your back on the street. Moreover, it is said that boy/girl friendships are often associated with insults, sarcasm and inappropriate sexual humour. Hilarious as it may sound, this can actually strengthen and add a spark to the bond of friendship between the two parties. It is another way of earning each others' trust.</p>
            
<p>If you are best of friends with a person of the opposite gender, you might have noticed well that there is less ‘drama’ involved. Girls are reputed for their ‘drama’ because of the small cat fights they get into at times. Jealousy could be named as the predominant cause of this and misunderstandings. Another good aspect of having a best friend from the opposite sex is that he or she....... </p>

            <h3>The Colombo Kandyans</h3>
            <p> The Colombo Kandyans are the people who were born and bred in the hills and have moved to Colombo for reasons like completing higher studies and taking on better jobs.
                Let me also put it this way.</p>

<p>The Colombo Kandyans are a group of people who are often disorientated by the fact that they have to live in two cities at the same time. They usually fall into different categories depending on their adaptability and how often they travel to and fro. Some of the Colombo Kandyans like the change and travel home quite less. They get accustomed to Colombo life and eventually settle down for good. Some others visit Kandy once in 2 or 3 months. They have embraced Colombo life but, yearn to indulge in the climate and sights of Kandy once in a while. The third and the most common category of the Colombo Kandyans are the ones who travel to Kandy every weekend or so. This group is the most disorientated. They dislike the change no matter how hard they try to adjust themselves. They don’t have a choice but to travel to Kandy every weekend due to reasons like missing home or the Colombo heat getting in their nerves or just for the sake of going to Kandy as a habit. Not that it is really necessary, but they are naturally obliged towards Kandy and are adamant to visit home every weekend. Going up and down can be a real hassle. But, seriously, how fun are the train rides? </p>

 <p>Considering all of them in general, every Colombo Kandyan have confronted similar situations at some point in their lives, before or after moving to Colombo. For those of you who are uncertain as to why Kandyans move to Colombo, it is mainly because the hills lack good higher education opportunities/ facilities and jobs according to the opinions of many individuals.</p>

<p>If you are a Colombo Kandyan let me help you recall how hyped up you were about moving to Colombo in the beginning. You couldn’t wait to leave Kandy and you kept counting the days to move into the capital. You packed the best of your clothes, filled social media with the news, planned your entire future in Colombo and dreamed of all the amazing things you could do there...</p>

           <h3>Books before Movies!</h3>
           <p>I have often heard people say “darn the book. Why read when you could simply watch the movie and enjoy the story?”. It’s actually an understatement. Watching the movie after reading the book, gives way to a whole new level of fun. Wanting to prove this, I carefully compared, contrasted and evaluated many of my book-movie experiences. Below are the facts which prove that reading the book before watching the respective movie is more productive and enjoyable.</p>
           <p>Many movies/TV series could confuse you if you are unaware of the background to the story. Reading the novel can actually prevent you from questioning while watching the movie. Once my mom and I watched Angels and Demons together, and she showered me with a whole lot of questions. I had read the book and I knew what was happening. Although I very proudly explained things to my mom, I was agitated whenever I had to pause to clear out her doubts. Similarly, as much as this could confuse you, it could also make you misunderstand things. Especially characters, since much of their personality is revealed through their thoughts, which movies tend to neglect. Tyrion Lannister of Game of Thrones is one such character. When my friend who first watched the series declared her dislike for Tyrion, on my request she read the book and imminently understood that he was in fact one of the best men in the story. The TV series does not highlight his exceptional character so well like the book does, so she misapprehended him.....</p>
